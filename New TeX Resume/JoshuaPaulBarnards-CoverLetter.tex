	\begin{cvletter}
		
		\lettersection{About Me}
		During my high school years I was home-schooled and attended the Santa Rosa Junior College as part of the High School Enrichment Program.  I started by taking the beginning computer courses were I met fellow students who hired me to tutor them about computers, then to repair and build their computers.   Since then I have continued working on computers as both a hobby and a side-job.  After graduating from my undergraduate program I returned to the SRJC to study computer architecture and programming, allowing me to have a deeper understanding of computers and how they function. 
		
		\lettersection{Why Mendocino College?}
		Thou I am from Santa Rosa, my immediate family is from Fort Bragg, and the entire Northern California Coast from San Francisco to Oregon.  I have always felt a strong connection to the people, cultures and landscapes of this wondrous corner of our World.
		Mendocino has given me the opportunity to expand my skill-sets and grow as a person, and I want to return these gifts by helping the local community and people with my skills and abilities.
		
		\lettersection{Why Me?}
		I have a deep passion for learning, believing that education is apart of our life's journey and that we should never stop growing.  That helping others is the best way for us to use our knowledge to contribute back to society.  I enjoy the process of solving problems through research and critical thinking, and would enjoy the opportunity to help my local community with Mendocino Unified School District.
